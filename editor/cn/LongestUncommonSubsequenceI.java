//Given two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this t
//wo strings. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequen
//ce of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of
// the other string. 
//
// A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting
// some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially
//, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of 
//any string. 
//
// The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the l
//ongest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, 
//return -1. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba", 
//because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba", 
//but not a subsequence of the other string "cdc".
//Note that "cdc" can be also a longest uncommon subsequence.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
//Output: 3
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
//Output: -1
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// Both strings' lengths will be between [1 - 100]. 
// Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.
