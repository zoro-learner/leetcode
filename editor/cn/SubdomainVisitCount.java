//A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. A
//t the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and a
//t the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like "discuss
//.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" i
//mplicitly. 
//
// Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of v
//isits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An ex
//ample of a count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com". 
//
// We are given a list cpdomains of count-paired domains. We would like a list o
//f count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), tha
//t explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain. 
//
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: 
//["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
//Output: 
//["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
//Explanation: 
//We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed above, t
//he subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So they will all be 
//visited 9001 times.
//
// 
//
// 
//Example 2:
//Input: 
//["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
//Output: 
//["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 i
//ntel.mail.com","951 com"]
//Explanation: 
//We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.c
//om" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. For the subdomains, we will visit "mail.com" 90
//0 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.
//
// 
//
// Notes: 
//
// 
// The length of cpdomains will not exceed 100. 
// The length of each domain name will not exceed 100. 
// Each address will have either 1 or 2 "." characters. 
// The input count in any count-paired domain will not exceed 10000. 
// The answer output can be returned in any order.
