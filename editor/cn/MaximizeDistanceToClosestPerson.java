//In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represent
//s that the seat is empty. 
//
// There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting. 
//
// Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the clos
//est person to him is maximized. 
//
// Return that maximum distance to closest person. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: 
//If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has d
//istance 2.
//If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
//Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2. 
//
// 
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,0,0,0]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 
//If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
//This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
// 
// 
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 2 <= seats.length <= 20000 
// seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.
