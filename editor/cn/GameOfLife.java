//According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as 
//Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton C
//onway in 1970." 
//
// Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or d
//ead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, dia
//gonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article): 
//
//
// 
// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-
//population. 
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generatio
//n. 
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-populat
//ion.. 
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
// reproduction. 
// 
//
// Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board gi
//ven its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules sim
//ultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur si
//multaneously. 
//
// Example: 
//
// 
//Input: 
//[
//¬† [0,1,0],
//¬† [0,0,1],
//¬† [1,1,1],
//¬† [0,0,0]
//]
//Output: 
//[
//¬† [0,0,0],
//¬† [1,0,1],
//¬† [0,1,1],
//¬† [0,1,0]
//]
// 
//
// Follow up: 
//
// 
// Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at t
//he same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated valu
//es to update other cells. 
// In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the 
//board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches th
//e border of the array. How would you address these problems?
