//Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the 
//price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a t
//ransaction fee. 
// You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the tr
//ansaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock
// at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.) 
// Return the maximum profit you can make. 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
//Output: 8
//Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
// Buying at prices[0] = 1 Selling at prices[3] = 8 Buying at prices[4] = 4 Sell
//ing at prices[5] = 9 The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
// 
// 
//
// Note:
// 0 < prices.length <= 50000. 
// 0 < prices[i] < 50000. 
// 0 <= fee < 50000.
