//You are given two images img1 and img2 both of size n x n, represented as bina
//ry, square matrices of the same size. (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as val
//ues.) 
//
// We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down
// any number of units), and place it on top of the other image. After, the overla
//p of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images. 
//
// (Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.) 
//
// What is the largest possible overlap? 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We slide img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
//
//The number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3. (Shown in red)
//
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]]
//Output: 1
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]]
//Output: 0
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// n == img1.length 
// n == img1[i].length 
// n == img2.length 
// n == img2[i].length 
// 1 <= n <= 30 
// img1[i][j] is 0 or 1. 
// img2[i][j] is 0 or 1.
