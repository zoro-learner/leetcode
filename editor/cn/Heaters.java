//Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard he
//ater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses. 
//
// Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find
// out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heat
//ers. 
//
// So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and yo
//ur expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters. 
//
// Note: 
//
// 
// Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exc
//eed 25000. 
// Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not e
//xceed 10^9. 
// As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed. 
// All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same
//. 
// 
//
// 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,2,3],[2]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the r
//adius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
// 
//
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use
// radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
